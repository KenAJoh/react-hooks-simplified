# React-snippets: simplified

A collection of snippets you will actually use.

## Features

Made for daily use when developing react-applications.

## Snippets

| Snippet |               |
| ------- | ------------- |
| `usee`  | useEffect     |
| `uses`  | useState      |
| `usec`  | useCallback   |
| `usem`  | useMemo       |
| `user`  | useRef        |
| `uset`  | useTransition |

## Exmplanation

### imr - Import React

```javascript
import * as React from "react";
```

## Commands

### React: class to className

Changes all occurences of `class` in JSX to `className`. This transform is safe
to run multiple times on any document. No text needs to be selected as the
command is executed on the entire document.

## Thank You! ❤️

While I wrote the initial version of this extension, many people (too many to name) have helped make it what it is today. From providing TypeScript definitions to keeping up with changing API and best practices. If you are enjoying this extension, you have the great React community to thank.
